# LunaCLI - Command Line Interface for Database Management

LunaCLI is a command-line tool designed to interact with POSTGRESQL. It allows users to connect, execute SQL commands, and configure connection settings dynamically.

## Features
- Connect to PostgreSQL databases with custom credentials.
- Change database connection settings (username, password, database name, and port).
- Execute SQL commands directly from the CLI.
- Supports dynamic port configuration.
- Supports various database operations like transactions, table management, and schema creation.
- Create an entity and clone it to connect to the terminal.

## **Some features that I've been working on**  

LunaCLI is evolving! We are excited to introduce the following upcoming features to enhance usability and efficiency:  

### **üìä Display Query Results in Table Format**  
- Query results will now be displayed in a structured table format for better readability.  
- Example:  
  ```
  +----+---------+-----------------+
  | ID |  Name   | Email           |
  +----+---------+-----------------+
  |  1 |  Alice  | alice@mail.com  |
  |  2 |  Bob    | bob@mail.com    |
  +----+---------+-----------------+
  ```  

### **üìú History Command**  
- View previously executed commands with the `history` command.  
- Example:  
  ```
  $ history
  1. select-from users
  2. insert-into orders (1, "Laptop", 5000)
  3. update users set name="John" where id=2
  ```
- Easily re-execute a command using `!<command_number>`.  
  ```
  $ !2  # Runs "insert-into orders (1, 'Laptop', 5000)"
  ```

### **‚è≥ Scheduled Command Execution**  
- Schedule recurring SQL commands to run automatically.  
- Example:  
  ```
  $ schedule run "delete-from logs where created_at < NOW() - interval '7 days'" daily at 02:00
  ```
- Supports scheduling backups and routine maintenance tasks.  

### **üìÇ Execute SQL Files**  
- Run `.sql` files directly from LunaCLI.  
- Example:  
  ```
  $ execute-file schema.sql
  ```
- Ideal for batch execution of SQL scripts.  

### **üì§ Export Table Data to JSON & CSV**  
- Save query results as JSON or CSV files.  
- Example:  
  ```
  $ export users format:json
  ```
  ```
  $ export orders format:csv
  ```

### **üìà Basic Graph Support**  
- Visualize query results with simple terminal-based graphs.  
- Example:  
  ```
  $ visualize select count(*) from orders group by category
  ```
- Helps in quick data analysis and trend identification.  



## Prerequisites
Before running LunaCLI, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java 17 or higher**
- **Maven** (for building the project)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database connectivity)

## Installation
Clone the repository and build the project using Maven:
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/doguhannilt/LunaCLI.git
 cd LunaCLI
 mvn clean package
```

## Usage

### Running the CLI
To start the LunaCLI, execute:
```sh
 java -jar LunaCLI.jar
```

### Connecting to a Database (PostgresSQL)
Use the following command to connect:
```sh
 luna connect postgresql username:yourUser password:yourPassword database:yourDatabase
```
Example:
```sh
 luna connect postgresql username:admin password:1234 database:mydb
```

### Changing the Database Port
To change the port dynamically, use:
```sh
 luna port:5433
```
After changing the port, restart LunaCLI for changes to take effect.

### Executing SQL Commands
Once connected, you can execute SQL queries directly:
```sh
 SELECT * FROM users;
```
![select-from](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a772bf09-4840-4463-b3d6-91ce8e8d1fa7)

### Displaying Connection Info
To view current connection settings:
```sh
 luna info
```
This will output details like database name, port, and connection status.
